# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. Designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python specifically. Learn about *functions*, *arguments*, and *return values* (oh my!); *variables* and *types*; *conditionals* and *Boolean expressions*; and *loops*. Learn how to handle *exceptions*, find and fix *bugs*, and write *unit tests*; use *third-party libraries*; validate and extract data with *regular expressions*; model real-world entities with *classes*, *objects*, *methods*, and *properties*; and read and write *files*. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.
